# Introduction
This project is a login form that can be used in websites. The login form throws an error when hitting login since it is not attached to an actual page or website, but it contains the components and animations necessary to attach it to future websites.

## General Information
The purpose of this project was to create a login form that can be easily imported into future projects. It can be edited to fit the theming and usage requirements for various types of websites, and any features can be easily added or removed as necessary. The login form strikes a balance between functionality and aesthetics, ensuring that it's easy to use, fully featured, and also improves the look of the website. I undertook this project to create a component that I can reuse in the future, and to practice my skills with the technologies used.
